IMAGING:
CT Abdomen/Pelvis w/o contrast 9/28/18
       Lung Bases: No acute or significant lung base finding.  Normal 
       heart size. No pleural or pericardial effusion. 
 
       Liver: The liver is normal in size.  No focal lesions. 
 
       Gallbladder and Biliary Tree: Unremarkable 
 
       Spleen: Unremarkable 
 
       Pancreas: The pancreas is grossly normal in appearance. 
 
       Adrenal Glands: Unremarkable 
 
       Kidneys: Right kidney: The right kidney is slightly smaller in
       size, in comparison to the left, with a grossly normal without
       contour calculi or hydronephrosis.  There is a punctate
       calcification suggestive of vascular etiology.  There are few
       small renal hypodensities suggestive of renal cysts. 
 
       Left kidney: The left kidney is enlarged with multiple large 
       partially exophytic hypodense lesions compatible with renal 
       cysts, some demonstrating thin peripheral calcification.  Largest 
       left renal cyst with peripheral calcific calcification interpolar 
       to lower pole region measuring 6.6 x 6.2 cm.  There is mild to 
       moderate hydroureteronephrosis with perinephric and periureteral 
       fat stranding.  There are multiple left renal calculi, largest 
       measuring up to 1.7 cm in the lower pole with Houndsfield units 
       measuring up to 1300.  There is an obstructive 0.7 cm renal 
       calculus measuring 1124 HU  in the distal ureter just proximal to 
       the UVJ 
 
       Bladder: Bladder is underdistended limiting evaluation.  There is 
       subtle fat density along the mucosa suggestive of chronic 
       inflammation. 
 
       Bowel: The stomach is grossly normal in appearance. Small bowel 
       and colon are normal in caliber and distribution.  Normal 
       appendix is visualized in the right lower quadrant without 
       findings of appendicitis. 
 
       Ascites: Absent 
 
       Lymphadenopathy: No mesenteric, retroperitoneal or periportal 
       lymphadenopathy. 
 
       Abdominal Wall and Mesentery: Unremarkable. 
 
       Vasculature: The visualized abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. 
        There is atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta and its 
       branches. Evaluation of abdominal and pelvic vessels is limited 
       due to lack of intravenous contrast. 
 
       Pelvic Organs: Prostate is enlarged. 
 
       Musculoskeletal: No aggressive focal bony lesions, acute 
       fractures or dislocation.   Multilevel degenerative changes noted 
       in the visualized spine. 
 
     Impression: 
       Obstructive 0.7 cm left ureteral calculus causing mild to 
       moderate left hydroureteronephrosis. Multiple additional left 
       renal calculi measuring up to 1.7 cm.  Associated left 
       perinephric fat stranding without evidence of abscess or capsular 
       rupture.
